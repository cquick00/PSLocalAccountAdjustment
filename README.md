# PSLocalAccountAdjustment

## **Purpose**

This project was something I wrote up in a short time for work. I needed a way to fix issues we were having where the former System Administrators didn't properly set up the local admin accounts on our computers. This particular version has been stripped of anything pertaining to our company info and has actually been improved slightly farther than the one I implemented for work.

## **Upcoming Improvements**

- Get user inputs for variables
- Add options for excluding specific computers :white_check_mark:
